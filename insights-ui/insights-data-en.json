    "what's working": "You have a strong research-first approach to complex work — like systematically having Claude explore your match-system codebase before weaving AI image analysis into investment proposal content. When things hit walls (like the Vercel deployment saga), you show good instincts for pivoting to alternative approaches rather than giving up, and your contained UI tasks like the speed button swap go smoothly because you scope them well.",
    "what's hindering you": "On Claude's side, it struggles badly with platform-specific UI navigation it can't actually see — the Vercel deployment burned significant time on wrong dashboard instructions before the API workaround landed. On your side, your content-heavy PPT sessions tend to stall in open-ended research mode without producing a finished deliverable, and observer/memory sessions often end with exploration but no concrete artifact to show for it.",
    "quick wins to try": "Try creating a custom skill (via `/command`) for your recurring PPT enhancement workflow that forces a two-phase structure: research first, then generate content — so Claude doesn't spend the whole session exploring. Also look into task agents for your cross-system analysis work, where one sub-agent maps the codebase while another drafts the actual deliverable in parallel.",
    "ambitious workflows": "As models get more capable, your Vercel-style deployment friction should vanish — imagine Claude autonomously attempting configs via API, running verification checks, and self-correcting without you needing to course-correct through multiple cycles. Your research-then-execute PPT work is also ripe for parallel agent orchestration, where coordinated sub-agents handle codebase discovery and content generation simultaneously and merge results into a finished artifact in one shot."
